Run the ORK planning phase:

Execute `.\scripts\ork-plan.ps1` to generate a structured plan with milestones and acceptance tests.

The plan will be saved to `plans/plan-<id>.md` with:
- Milestones breakdown
- Acceptance criteria (unit/integration/UI)
- Test coverage mapping
- Schema validation

After completion, report the plan file path and next steps.
